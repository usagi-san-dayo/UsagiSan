# UsagiSan
The package UsagiSan provides functions for data cleansing and summarizing the results of statistical test, and helps to reduce the time on several boring sections of statistical tests.
In data analysis, you may want to output results of statistical tests to excel sheets to visualise significant variables with a specified color. With this, you can edit those excel sheets coloring significant variables and headers of each summary sheet without opening a xlsx file.
